# ðŸ“š Sorting-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental sorting algorithms in C++. These algorithms are widely used in computer science for ordering data efficiently and understanding algorithmic time complexities.

## ðŸ”§ Algorithms Included

| Algorithm        | File Name         | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort      | `bubble_sort`     | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if out of order |
| Selection Sort   | `selection_sort`  | Selects the minimum element and places it at the beginning |
| Insertion Sort   | `insertion_sort`  | Builds the sorted array one element at a time |
| Merge Sort       | `merge_sort`      | Divide and conquer algorithm with O(n log n) complexity |
| Quick Sort       | `quick_sort`      | Highly efficient, uses partitioning to sort |
| Bucket Sort      | `bucket_sort`     | Distributes elements into buckets and sorts individually |

> ðŸ“Œ Each file is a standalone C++ program.

## ðŸ“¥ How to Run
